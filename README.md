# üé® Customization Options

## Shapes

So far, users can choose between 3 different shapes: a circle, a square, and a hexagon. 

## Height

Height is calcualated in px and is inserted as an integer. At the moment, you can specify height but not width. Therefore, you cannot make the circle and oval nor can you make the square a rectangle.

## Default Color

You may specify the default color to set your colorpicker to. This value must be a hex. Non-hex values or string like 'red' will render the default value to be black.

`npm i shapely-colorpicker`
